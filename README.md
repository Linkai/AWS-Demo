1, how to create EC2 and login with key pair from windows, linux, and mac
EC2 instance can be created in different regions, you can only display the instance in one region at the same time and cannot see the instance in other region, unless region is changed to specific one.
login Windows instance: rdp-->key pair will decrypt password for it.
login Linux instance: openssh-->putty, and puttygen, load private key file .pem and generate private key .ppk; public IP or public DNS
